# Running Ball Game
- Practicing frontend development highly working on js and Css. 
This is just practical task used to understand core features of programming while having fun building a game. 
As a juniour programmer working on this task was helpful. I got through a lot while building, learnt embressing through code bugs and wrapped this cool game.
